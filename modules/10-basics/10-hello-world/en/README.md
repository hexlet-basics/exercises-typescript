As is tradition, we'll start by writing a 'Hello, World!' program. The program will print the following text:

<pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  Hello, World!
</pre>

To print something, you need to give computer a special command. In TypeScript, we use console.log().

## Launch special features

The TypeScript compiler works slower than needed for code-basics exercises. Because of this, TypeScript errors in this course are only shown in the editor itself - highlighted in red and revealed when you hover.

During the exercise execution, only JavaScript errors are shown. This means that you should make sure that there are no red underscores in the editor before checking the code.

If you want to test the examples on your computer for correct behavior, make sure you use the `--strict` flag.
