Implement the `getOlderUser()` function that takes two users as input and returns the one who is older. If the users are of the same age, `null` is returned:

```typescript
const user1 = { name: 'Petr', age: 8 };
```

Define an alias for the user to avoid duplicating the definition of its type in the function parameters.
