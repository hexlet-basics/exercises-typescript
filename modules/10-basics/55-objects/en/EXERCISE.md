Implement the `isComplete()` function that takes a course as input and determines if it is complete. A course is considered complete if four or more lessons have been added to it:

```typescript
// Determine the type based on the structure of the object
const course = {
  name: 'Java',
  lessons: ['variables', 'functions', 'conditions'],
};
isComplete(course); // false
```
