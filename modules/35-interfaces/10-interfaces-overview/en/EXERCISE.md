You are given the IVehicle interface. The task is to implement a Car class based on this interface, which will have a calcFuelNeeded method that accepts the distance in kilometers and returns the fuel consumption for the specified distance. The Car class should also have a constructor function that accepts and implements the properties specified in the interface.

```typescript
const porche = new Car(4, 'red', true, 20);
console.log(porche.calcFuelNeeded(200)); // 40
```
